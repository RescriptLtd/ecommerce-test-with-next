This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app).

Time spent: 6h

# Getting started
Clone the repo and run the following commands in a terminal:

	$ yarn install

	$ npm run build

	$ npm start

open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

# Assumptions

This project leaves the complexities of real-life stock managment out of the picture. It is a proof of concept using Next.js as a wrapping framework for React. The implementation is super naive and should be taken for what it is: a test.

# Why Next?

Next.js makes routing, SSR and CSS-in-JS dead simple. I see it as the direct evolution of the notorious create-react-app.
